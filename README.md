# Assignment-1-Code-Refactor

## Revamping website code to look better and run smoother

For some good practice to get a better grasp of editing code I took on this project of going through and refactoring previously existing code.
By doing so I was able to make the new code easier to read and understand for future changes that may be added in future.

## Everybody is now Embracing the Internet 

This project is just a little taste of why coding is the future as more and more companies head online and nearly everyone has a smartphone.
Through this project I learned the importance of organizing code, without doing so you can end up lost when you need to go back and quickly make a change.
Looking at the new and improved code with it's easy readability you can see the importance of cleaning up code and keeping it organized.
