# Revamping Website Code!

## Refactoring website code to look better and run smoother

For some good practice to get a better grasp of editing code I took on this project of going through and refactoring previously existing code.
By doing so I was able to make the new code easier to read and understand for future developers who may need to make changes in the future.

## Everybody is now Embracing the Internet 

This project is just a little taste of why coding is the future. More and more companies are heading online and nearly everyone has a smartphone.
Through this project I learned the importance of organizing code, without doing so you can end up lost when you need to go back and quickly review the code.
Looking at the new and improved code with it's easy readability you can see the importance of cleaning up code and keeping it organized.
